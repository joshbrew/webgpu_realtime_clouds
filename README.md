# WebGPU Volumetric Clouds

Realtime WebGPU volumetric clouds with GPU-baked procedural noise, compute-shader raymarching, temporal reprojection, large cloud boxes, and a browser tuning playground.

The core renderer is `CloudComputeBuilder` in `clouds.js`. It consumes a weather map, a shape volume, a detail volume, and optional blue noise, then writes volumetric cloud color and alpha into a WebGPU texture. You can composite that texture in your own renderer or use the included preview compositor.

The tuning playground uses `NoiseComputeBuilder` from [`webgpu_noise_compute_textures`](https://github.com/joshbrew/webgpu_noise_compute_textures) to generate the input textures on the GPU.

## Try it

The flat-volume playground includes **Weather simulation → Evolving weather**.
It loops smoothly through twelve systems: broken/fair cumulus, developing towers,
anvil storms, Rain Shelf, widespread rain banks, overcast/breaking stratus,
wispy high clouds, feather cirrus, asperitas and clearing cumulus. Storm cells keep their identities among lower cumulus;
the wind continues to scroll the population. Weather and day/night periods are
independent. The optional day/night clock moves the directional source through
sunrise, daylight, sunset and moonlight, with twilight sky colors and stars.
Pause with the animation button; disabling the cycle restores the previous
scene and its animation state. This is an artistic weather director, not a
physical atmosphere simulation, and does not alter the planetary renderer.

Six 256² weather maps are baked once on entry and cached in bounded named slots.
A small GPU blend updates one stable texture at 10 Hz (~3.5 MiB total RGBA16F
map storage); shape/detail textures are reused. There are no per-tick noise
rebakes, CPU readbacks, extra cloud-ray samples, or new shader variants. Existing
density/light fields still update as weather, wind and directional light change.
The mature anvil phase shares the standalone preset's shaping, breakup,
extinction and occlusion settings from `weather/cloudAnvilLook.js`. Cached maps retain
the authored green storm-selection channel with a stable domain/time across
all six coverage maps, preserving the varied storm population during blending.
Cell scale and height variation remain fixed throughout the loop; coverage and
development transition smoothly without rebuilding the clouds' anatomy.

Shelf, stratus and high-wisp density blend in that same fixed volume; the tall
clouds dissipate while lower decks develop, rather than scaling towers into
pancakes. Fully layered phases skip the convective cell loop. Adding these
systems does not increase the six-map cache or add passes/ray samples. The Rain
Shelf phase represents cloud morphology, not rendered precipitation particles.
Its folded banks borrow the standalone layer's shape-band remap and ridge/valley
breakup, with gentler shell erosion that preserves a thick connected interior.
Two additional voxel-filtered texture reads run only in shelf-bearing density
bakes, never along screen rays. Their independent co-moving domain leaves
cumulus/anvil texture scale unchanged during transitions; the standalone Rain
Shelf preset is unchanged.
Cycle preparation and map submissions are included in the timing reports.
Moonlit cloud contrast adapts smoothly instead of crushing the dim volumes to
black. The cached-volume ray path also uses stable, decorrelated integer jitter
to avoid diagonal sampling bands without an additional texture fetch.

**Layer preset → Arbitrary Volume Gallery** surrounds the torus with a cube,
ellipsoid, capsule and octahedron. They rotate independently at different speeds
using the same cached density/light and raymarch stages; no separate meshes or
per-shape rendering passes are used.
The fast gallery rotations refresh all rays at the selected coarse resolution
to avoid stale interleave bands; leaving the gallery restores the previous
temporal ray budget. Ordinary cloud presets keep their existing interleave.

## Install and run

Run the build/dev commands from the shared `noiseCompute` project root (two
directories above this folder). The renderer and demos use its bundler to load
WGSL as text and produce the separate worker bundle.

```bash
npm install
```

If `tinybuild` is not installed globally:

```bash
npm i -g tinybuild
```

Run the local demo:

```bash
tinybuild
```

Then open the page served by your local dev setup.

You can also serve prebuilt files with any static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Browser requirements

Use a current Chromium-based browser with:

- WebGPU enabled.
- JavaScript module worker support.
- `OffscreenCanvas` support.
- Enough GPU memory for the weather map, 3D shape/detail volumes, blue noise, history textures, and output texture.

```

Public renderer, demo and planet integration entry points remain at their
existing paths. Shaders are grouped under `shaders/`; weather-only modules live
under `weather/`. This is a file-layout change, not a rendering change.

## Testing

From this `tools/clouds` folder:

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

Tests cover preset parity, phase continuity, cache/pipeline behavior, planet
styles, MC33, temporal history and local import paths. To check the complete
demo and worker bundles, run `npm run build` from the `noiseCompute` project root.

For the manual WebGPU anvil check:

```bash
node tests/browser/serveWeatherAnvil.mjs
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8766/check` to compare density, lighting and rendered pixels
against the standalone anvil with identical inputs. `/demo` is the actual flat
demo with only its weather clock held at the mature anvil phase for visual
review; enable **Evolving weather** to view it. Wind still runs normally.
Stop the server with Ctrl+C when finished.

`http://127.0.0.1:8766/planet-gas` checks the production Hail Mary weather bake
across three seeds, reports equal-area rust/thread coverage, and previews the
shared palette on a diagnostic globe (not the full cloud/terrain compositor).
For repeatable full-simulation review, start the same server with
`PLANET_REVIEW=1` and open `/demo?demo=planet`. That test-only mode selects Hail
Mary with terrain seed 17 and holds the sun fixed; ordinary production weather
shaders, cloud animation, terrain and camera controls are unchanged.

The check requires a WebGPU-capable browser and the project's existing esbuild
installation (local esbuild or the Windows global tinybuild dependency).
`ESBUILD_MODULE` can point to another existing esbuild installation. Bundled
diagnostic outputs stay in a temporary directory, not the source tree.

# What the renderer does

The renderer is a compute-based volumetric cloud pass.

1. Intersect each camera ray with a world-space cloud box.
2. Sample weather, shape, and detail textures to estimate cloud density.
3. March through the box with adaptive step lengths.
4. Evaluate sun transmittance and phase lighting at protected intervals.
5. Accumulate color and alpha into an output storage texture.
6. Optionally reuse temporal history for animated/reprojected rendering.
7. Optionally composite the output through `shaders/cloudsRender.wgsl`.

The renderer includes performance-oriented shader logic for large and tall boxes:

- Weather-column empty skipping.
- Column-style Y-bounds acceleration derived from the weather field.
- Active-Y ray clipping plus a global active-Y early-out for rays that cross the tall AABB but never cross the actual cloud profile band.
- Protected near/edge lighting so close silhouettes do not smear or card out.
- Far proxy sampling for safe horizon/interior cloud samples.
- Adaptive thick-box stepping and lighting skip.

- Original-style cloud body sampling is preserved by default. The experimental Y-domain compensation remains opt-in through `verticalTextureHomogeneity`.
- Compact temporal interleave dispatch when history is available. Skipped pixels are not launched as cloud rays. The previous history is copied forward before the owned subset overwrites it.

The far proxy path is intentionally conservative. It keeps the same weather and shape style but avoids some full 3D/detail work where the cloud is far, screen-small, and visually safe.

# Library usage

## 1. Create WebGPU objects

```js
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
if (!adapter) throw new Error('WebGPU adapter unavailable');

const device = await adapter.requestDevice();
const queue = device.queue;
```

The playground requests a larger `maxBufferSize` when available because high-resolution noise baking and debug readbacks can need large staging buffers.

## 2. Create a `CloudComputeBuilder`

```js
import { CloudComputeBuilder } from './clouds.js';

const clouds = new CloudComputeBuilder(device, queue);
```

`CloudComputeBuilder` owns its compute pipeline, uniform buffers, bind groups, optional output textures, cached coarse/upsample resources, and the optional preview compositor.

## 3. Provide cloud input textures

```js
clouds.setInputMaps({
  weatherView,      // texture_2d_array view
  shape3DView,      // texture_3d view
  detail3DView,     // texture_3d view
  blueView,         // optional blue-noise texture view
  motionView,       // optional reprojection motion texture
  depthPrevView,    // optional previous depth texture
  historyPrevView,  // optional previous cloud history
  historyOutView,   // optional output history target
});
```

Optional views can be omitted. The builder binds safe dummy textures when a view is missing.

## 4. Create or attach an output texture

Let the builder allocate the output texture:

```js
clouds.createOutputTexture(width, height, 1, 'rgba16float');
```

Or attach a texture owned by your renderer:

```js
clouds.setOutputView(existingView, {
  width,
  height,
  layers: 1,
  format: 'rgba16float',
});
```

If you allocate the texture yourself, use flags compatible with your pipeline. A typical texture needs storage writes and later sampling or copy usage:

```js
const outTex = device.createTexture({
  size: [width, height, 1],
  format: 'rgba16float',
  usage:
    GPUTextureUsage.STORAGE_BINDING |
    GPUTextureUsage.TEXTURE_BINDING |
    GPUTextureUsage.COPY_SRC |
    GPUTextureUsage.COPY_DST,
});
```

## 5. Set the world-space cloud box

```js
clouds.setBox({
  center: [0, 0, 0],
  half: [18, 0.3, 18],
  uvScale: 1.0,
});
```

`center` and `half` define the raymarched world-space AABB. `uvScale` controls weather-map mapping over the cloud box. For horizon-scale clouds, increase X/Z size and rely on render scale, adaptive stepping, far proxy, and temporal accumulation rather than hard visible-density culling.

## 6. Set camera and sun

```js
clouds.setViewFromCamera({
  camPos,
  right,
  up,
  fwd,
  fovYDeg,
  aspect,
});

clouds.setSunByAngles({
  azimuthDeg: 45,
  elevationDeg: 41,
  camPos,
});
```

You can also pass a sun vector directly:

```js
clouds.setLight({
  sunDir,
  camPos,
});
```

## 7. Set appearance, transforms, tuning, and reprojection

```js
clouds.setParams({
  globalCoverage: 1.0,
  globalDensity: 1000.0,
  cloudAnvilAmount: 0.1,
  cloudBeer: 6.0,
  silverIntensity: 12.0,
  silverExponent: 12.0,
});

clouds.setNoiseTransforms({
  shapeScale: 0.1,
  detailScale: 1.0,
  weatherScale: 1.0,
  shapeBias: 0.4,
  weatherBias: 0.3,
});

clouds.setTuning({
  maxSteps: 256,
  sunSteps: 6,
  sunStride: 3,
  fluffFactor: 2.0,
  alphaCutoff: 0.98,
  frontOcclusionStrength: 0.72,
  frontOcclusionAlpha: 0.66,
  frontOcclusionStepBoost: 3.0,
  sliceJitterStrength: 0.18,
  verticalLayerDecorrelation: 0.35,
  directLightBlend: 0.78,
  directLightBoost: 0.58,
  alphaBoostThreshold: 0.22,
  alphaBoostAmount: 0.16,
});

clouds.setReprojSettings({
  enabled: 1,
  subsample: 4,
  temporalBlend: 0.94,
  frameIndex,
  fullWidth: width,
  fullHeight: height,
});
```

## 8. Dispatch

Full resolution:

```js
await clouds.dispatch({
  coarseFactor: 1,
  wait: true,
});
```

Reduced resolution, upsampled to the output size:

```js
await clouds.dispatch({
  coarseFactor: 4,
  wait: true,
});
```

`coarseFactor` is the render scale divider. `1` means full resolution. `2` means half resolution per axis. `5` means one fifth resolution per axis, then upsampled to the full output texture.

Rectangular dispatch:

```js
await clouds.dispatchRect({
  x,
  y,
  w,
  h,
  coarseFactor: 4,
  wait: true,
});
```

## 9. Composite to a canvas

```js
clouds.renderToCanvas(canvas, {
  cam: { camPos, right, up, fwd, fovYDeg, aspect },
  sunDir,
  skyColor: [0.60, 0.75, 0.98],
  exposure: 1.18,
  gradeStyle: 3,
  sunBloom: 0.18,
  godRaysEnabled: true,
  godRayStrength: 1.0,
  layerIndex: 0,
});
```

In a full renderer, you can skip `renderToCanvas()` and sample the cloud output texture from your own composite pass.

## 10. Cleanup

```js
clouds.dispose();
```

The builder destroys resources it created internally. Textures passed into `setInputMaps()` or `setOutputView()` remain the caller's responsibility.

# Noise texture library integration

The playground bakes all procedural input maps with `NoiseComputeBuilder` from the companion noise library:

```js
import { NoiseComputeBuilder } from '../noise/noiseCompute.js';
import { CloudComputeBuilder } from './clouds.js';

const noise = new NoiseComputeBuilder(device, queue);
const clouds = new CloudComputeBuilder(device, queue);

noise.initBlitRender?.();
noise.buildPermTable(seed);
```

The cloud renderer itself does not require `NoiseComputeBuilder`. It only needs valid texture views. The playground uses the noise library because it is convenient to bake and preview the weather, shape, detail, and blue-noise textures entirely on the GPU.

## Weather map baking

The weather map is a `512 x 512` 2D array texture. The playground uses one texture key, `weather2d`, and writes channels separately:

- Output channel `1`: weather R, base coverage.
- Output channel `2`: weather G, billow modulation.
- Output channel `3`: weather B, optional extra modulation.

```js
const weatherRView = await noise.computeToTexture(512, 512, {
  mode: 'computeFBM4D',
  seed: 123456789001,
  zoom: 4,
  freq: 1,
  octaves: 5,
  lacunarity: 2,
  gain: 0.5,
  threshold: 0,
  seedAngle: Math.PI / 2,
  time: 0,
  voroMode: 0,
  edgeK: 0,
  warpAmp: 0,
  toroidal: 1,
}, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeFBM4D'],
  outputChannel: 1,
  textureKey: 'weather2d',
  viewDimension: '2d-array',
});

await noise.computeToTexture(512, 512, {
  seed: 123456789000,
  zoom: 4,
  freq: 1.5,
  octaves: 4,
  lacunarity: 2,
  gain: 0.5,
  threshold: 0,
  seedAngle: Math.PI / 2,
  time: 0,
  toroidal: 1,
}, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeBillow4D'],
  outputChannel: 2,
  textureKey: 'weather2d',
  viewDimension: '2d-array',
});

const weatherView = noise.get2DView('weather2d', { dimension: '2d-array' }) || weatherRView;
```

The worker uses `sanitizeEntry()` before baking. If a requested entry point is unavailable, it falls back to a compatible default. 4D weather modes get `toroidal: 1` so the weather map can tile across a horizon-scale box without visibly stretching.

## Shape volume baking

The shape volume is a `128 x 128 x 128` 3D texture. It stores the main cloud body and lower-frequency sculpting bands.

```js
await noise.computeToTexture3D(128, 128, 128, {
  seed,
  zoom: 4,
  freq: 1,
  octaves: 2,
  lacunarity: 2,
  gain: 0.5,
  threshold: 0,
  seedAngle: Math.PI / 2,
  time: 0,
  voroMode: 4,
  edgeK: 0,
  warpAmp: 0,
  toroidal: 1,
  band: 'base',
}, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeAntiWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 1,
  id: 'shape128',
});

await noise.computeToTexture3D(128, 128, 128, { seed, zoom: 2, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeAntiWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 2,
  id: 'shape128',
});

await noise.computeToTexture3D(128, 128, 128, { seed, zoom: 1, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeAntiWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 3,
  id: 'shape128',
});

await noise.computeToTexture3D(128, 128, 128, { seed, zoom: 0.5, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeAntiWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 4,
  id: 'shape128',
});

const shape3DView = noise.get3DView('shape128');
```

The playground restricts shape/detail modes to 4D-capable entry points. That keeps 3D volumes tileable and lets animation use offsets or time without reseeding the whole texture every frame.

## Detail volume baking

The detail volume is a `32 x 32 x 32` 3D texture. It is used mainly for edge erosion and small-scale turbulence.

```js
await noise.computeToTexture3D(32, 32, 32, { seed, zoom: 4, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 1,
  id: 'detail32',
});

await noise.computeToTexture3D(32, 32, 32, { seed, zoom: 2, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 2,
  id: 'detail32',
});

await noise.computeToTexture3D(32, 32, 32, { seed, zoom: 1, toroidal: 1 }, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeWorley4D'],
  outputChannel: 3,
  id: 'detail32',
});

const detail3DView = noise.get3DView('detail32');
```

## Blue noise baking

The playground bakes `256 x 256` blue noise with `computeBlueNoise`, then applies a small blur/contrast preprocess before binding it to the cloud shader. Blue noise drives ray jitter and temporal sampling. Close-up jitter is attenuated in the cloud shader so near clouds do not look peppered.

```js
const rawBlueView = await noise.computeToTexture(256, 256, {
  seed,
}, {
  noiseChoices: ['clearTexture', 'computeBlueNoise'],
  outputChannel: 1,
  textureKey: 'blue2d',
  viewDimension: '2d-array',
});
```

The worker then binds the filtered view as `blueView`. The cloud shader uses blue noise for screen-space ray jitter, slice jitter, local lighting jitter, sun-transmittance jitter, and a tiny lighting-noise lift. Do not remove it globally unless you also retune the near-edge and far-cloud stability path.

## Binding noise output to the cloud renderer

```js
clouds.setInputMaps({
  weatherView,
  shape3DView,
  detail3DView,
  blueView,
});
```

Use `setNoiseTransforms()` for animation and style adjustment. Do not re-bake 3D textures every frame unless you are intentionally changing seed, size, entry point, or noise construction.

# Playground baseline settings

These are the tuned starting points in `cloudTestThreaded.js`.

## Playground UI

The playground now starts with a sticky quick dock above the renderer. Use it for the high-frequency controls: render tab, tuning tab, texture tabs, layer preset, color grade, render divider, render, rebake, and advanced-control visibility. The original detailed panels are still present underneath. With Advanced off, lower-priority lighting and tuning fields are tucked away so the main workflow stays focused.

The 3D shape and detail texture previews each have their own Z slice slider directly under the canvas. The old shared slice slider still works and drives both previews together, but the per-texture sliders are easier for inspecting the actual volume textures.

Texture preview canvases render once after startup baking and can be refreshed from the worker with `refreshDebug`, so they should no longer stay blank after the first frame.

Startup keeps the UI responsive while shader compilation and GPU noise baking run in the worker. The playground immediately clears the canvas to the configured sky, but it deliberately does not display a simplified cloud proxy: the first cloud-bearing image comes from the regular raymarch and the same full-size resources used by later frames. This avoids a visible scene/layout swap when the expensive shader finishes compiling. The raymarch compiles asynchronously, so controls, progress text, and timing diagnostics continue updating during a cold driver compile.

The complete startup trace is exposed as `window.cloudStartupTiming` and is also emitted through the `cloud-startup-timing` window event. Its `stages` array covers UI/worker setup, the loading-sky clear, uniform uploads, every noise buffer/dispatch stage, pipeline warmup, output/history allocation, cloud dispatch encoding, command-buffer finish, queue submission, and GPU queue drains. `metadata.loadingSkyVisibleMs` reports the responsive loading state; `metadata.timeToFirstFrameMs` reports the first real raymarched cloud image. While work is still running, `window.cloudWorkerTiming` identifies the exact active worker stage and `window.cloudWorkerTimingHistory` keeps recent snapshots. Noise bake submission timings and GPU completion waits are labeled separately so an expensive GPU bake is not misreported as JavaScript buffering time.

`pipelineWarmup.computePipelines` now reports shader module creation/validation and each compute variant's `compileMs`, entrypoint, quality flag, and status. The same structured-cloneable object is available from `CloudComputeBuilder.getComputePipelineTimings()`. These are API wall times, not GPU execution timestamps; cached variants retain their original compile measurement. A large warmup `computeMs` with a small frame dispatch/queue wait means pipeline compilation, not texture buffering or raymarch resolution, is delaying startup.

Normal/exposure probes use compact loops to avoid repeatedly expanding the density/warp call graph during compilation. The regular pipeline excludes detailed density lighting only when the uploaded `sunStride > 1`, where that branch was already unreachable. Stride 1 (and lower values) selects the full lighting variant; tuning changes are awaited before worker dispatch. This does not introduce a separate low-quality first cloud image. Run the variant/cache regression tests with `node --test tests/cloudPipeline.test.mjs`.

### Rounded flat-volume clouds

Fair Cumulus, Broken Cumulus, Towering Cu, and Cumulonimbus Anvil use a hybrid of rounded growth envelopes and Rain Shelf-style volumetric noise. Individual billows grow outward in all axes and gain density gradually, with upper tiers developing after the lower ones. The full tower height stays fixed: weather does not stretch a pancake into a tall cloud. Wider lower shoulders and randomly leaning upper tiers avoid a repeated straight column. Cumulonimbus Anvil is a mixed weather population: stable random material-cell identities select 24% for tall storms, while other cells produce lower cumulus. Storm shoulders feed broad, shallow, staggered outflow fans before the upper turrets can hide their silhouette. Anvil amount and exaggeration control lateral spread, and the same volumetric breakup carves both canopy and body. The preset camera frames this scattered population more closely rather than presenting the box as one distant object. Cell classification travels with wind and never switches with evolving weather.

The shape base is remapped against its three FBM bands, and detail scallops/valleys carve density throughout the volume, not just the skin of solid ellipsoids. Independently advected detail also bends the scaffold and the shape-sampling domain, producing continuous billowing without height pumping. Cached lighting normals follow this noise-shaped signed field, independently of young-billow opacity limits. Detail uses a volume-appropriate scale (`0.04` times the thin-layer detail transform) so voxel filtering retains meaningful structure instead of collapsing to the final 1x1 mip. Y transforms preserve their sign but use square-root compression to avoid exaggerated horizontal rings on tall towers. All of this reuses the existing single shape/detail samples per density voxel, adding no raymarch noise or lighting probes. Tenuous output alpha and premultiplied radiance fade smoothly before temporal history using Min Alpha, attenuating pale scaffold outlines without a hard birth cutoff.

Developed rounded clouds retain connected optical mass beneath that breakup. A smooth interior support follows the noisy body and each billow's development limit; it gradually adds core density as maturity rises from 0.20 to 1.00. Fine and shadow density share this support, so the thicker body also casts thicker volume shadows. It is not a compositing alpha boost, and newborn puffs/outer wisps remain soft. Broad shape noise samples at `0.35` times the layer transform, while fine detail deformation is gentler; high-frequency noise no longer shreds the entire body. Noise still modulates interior density and lighting as well as the silhouette. These adjustments only affect cached flat-volume fields, not Rain Shelf or Wispy High.

Shape wind translates the entire cell lattice and its surface noise together (`world center = material center - shapeOffsetWorld.xz`). Weather is sampled in the co-moving domain, with its own slower offset controlling development. Per-voxel edge fading allows drifting cells to enter and leave the box without whole-center culling pops. Noise is filtered to the field's voxel footprint, without applying the thin layer's vertical/anvil distortions a second time. Preset cameras frame the volume from outside. Returning to a layer preset restores the saved layer camera, original thin volume, and original lighting. Wispy High keeps gentle erosion, no additive opacity boost, and a low alpha cutoff so translucent wisps survive. Rain Shelf's density and lighting path is unchanged. Preset changes pause an active animation until baking and a fresh full frame finish, then resume it.

Rounded forms split work into `buildCloudDensityField`, `buildCloudLightField`, a small field-reading `computeCloudBox`, and `resolveCloudFlat`. These dispatches share bindings/resources and execute in one compute pass and queue submission, with no CPU readback between them. Density and shadow/AO use two `128 x 64 x 128` RGBA16F textures (16 MiB combined), allocated lazily only when a rounded form is selected. Moving the camera reuses both fields; changing the sun rebuilds lighting only; changing scene/noise inputs rebuilds both. In-place noise rebakes explicitly invalidate the fields.

The lighting texture stores filterable sun-facing and sky-facing responses in RG, sun visibility in B and ambient visibility in A. It does not interpolate compressed normal coordinates: their encoding seam previously caused moving patches to flip shading. Broad form gradients are evaluated over 1.5 voxels, and empty cells bordering density also receive lighting to avoid a full-sun discontinuity at moving edges. Sun integration uses midpoint samples at approximately two per crossed density voxel, bounded to 16–48 samples during the cached bake; each screen-space ray step still reads one density and one lighting sample. This fixes temporal lighting stability without increasing texture sizes or adding passes. The grid remains fixed to the box, not a camera-relative fine-grid/clipmap; close fly-through detail is still limited by its world-space voxel size.

The Puffs controls expose size, height variation, and ambient occlusion. AO takes twelve neighboring density probes (six directions at two radii), weighted toward the outward hemisphere, during the cached lighting bake, not during each ray step. This emphasizes creases between billows instead of uniformly darkening opaque interiors. Changing AO strength blends that cached term without rebaking. A low-order scattering fill reuses cached sun visibility to reveal shaded billows without additional texture probes. Ray jitter reads the existing blue-noise map once per pixel, avoiding diagonal stripes from a correlated screen hash. Rounded preset cameras initially show sunlit shoulders; backlit angles remain available through camera controls. These changes affect rounded forms only, leaving the default layer look and call graph intact.

Rounded flat clouds use volume-aware preview finishing: the compositor retains their premultiplied volume radiance rather than reconstructing a painted surface from screen-space alpha. Broad noise folds drive cached normals, with stronger crease AO and less ambient fill, so shadow-side billows retain depth. A lighter aerial-fog treatment avoids washing out that lighting. Exposure, shadow contrast/darkness, color lift, saturation and lit/shadow tints still shape the result; the legacy screen-space rim/edge styling belongs to the layer compositor. The mode flag reuses render-uniform padding (the buffer remains 304 bytes), and changing forms refreshes it even when the camera and grade are unchanged. No new field samples, passes or bindings are needed. Rain Shelf and spherical clouds retain their original finishing path.

Rounded presets start scrolling automatically after baking and presenting a coherent first frame. Stop Reproject Anim pauses the current scene. The cell population is generated from an unbounded co-moving lattice, not a finite spawn list or a group wrapped back to its starting position. Incoming cells get their own seeded forms, weather and heights; their silhouettes fade through the fixed box edges. Coverage now supports a fuller spread of developed clouds across the volume, while sparsity still leaves irregular gaps. The worker advances wind using elapsed time without resetting offsets each frame.

Select **Rotating Cloud Donut** in the layer preset menu for an arbitrary-volume example. Its rotating torus boundary clips a fully 3D, independently scrolling noise population, not an extruded horizontal cloud layer or a marching-cubes mesh. The hole remains empty; cached lighting follows the moving boundary and noisy cloud folds. Rotation runs at 0.22 radians/second, initialized to a readable tilted view when entering the example. Leaving it restores the previous horizontal bounds and clears the torus mask. Other rounded presets still use the square volume and Rain Shelf remains unchanged.

`CloudComputeBuilder.setVolumeMask({ shape: "torus", rotationAngle: 1.05 })` configures the example; `shape: "box"` removes it. Partial updates retain existing values. A 64-byte field uniform includes mask parameters in the density/light cache signature, so rotating the boundary rebakes both fields while an irrelevant box rotation does not. `cloudTorusDistance` is the small signed-distance mask to replace when adding another arbitrary shape. There are no extra raymarch texture probes or CPU readbacks.

Flat raymarch and temporal resolve also use separate shader modules, passing unquantized f32 radiance through a 32-byte-per-pixel scratch buffer. Outputs exceeding the device's storage-binding limit retain inline resolve. `computeStages` in worker frame timings records density/light dispatches or cache hits, raymarch encoding, and temporal resolve encoding. Stage `encodeMs` values are CPU/API times; GPU queue completion remains separately reported. Pipeline timings list each entrypoint's compilation wall time. Cold driver compilation and disk-cache hits must be compared separately.

# Animation loop, visual FPS, and live editing

The playground animation loop is worker-owned. The main thread sends state, and the worker advances the cloud offsets, updates temporal phases, dispatches the cloud pass, and composites the result.

Key runtime rules:

- `Render Scale Divider` is the active cloud compute coarse factor for both still renders and animation. The final presentation canvas stays full size.
- Coarse animation computes the current reduced-resolution cloud buffer every frame, then upsamples it to the full presentation canvas.
- Temporal Interleave is a full-resolution history mode. It is automatically bypassed when `Render Scale Divider` is greater than `1`, because stacking interleave on top of coarse rendering can leave stale coarse texels that upsample into vertical or horizontal streaks.
- The worker keeps a small non-blocking GPU in-flight window for backpressure. The default window is `2` GPU frames in flight. The hot animation loop does not use a fixed every-N-frame `queue.onSubmittedWorkDone()` stall.
- Resize requests are coalesced and applied at frame boundaries so the WebGPU context and history textures are not reallocated repeatedly during a drag.
- Preview, cloud parameter, tuning, and transform edits are coalesced through `setLiveFrameState` while animation is running. Noise edits that require rebaking textures are still expensive.
- Camera edits do not reset the evolved `shapeOffsetWorld`, `detailOffsetWorld`, or `weatherOffsetWorld`. Transform controls update offsets explicitly; camera/tuning edits do not overwrite animated cloud time.
- The visible FPS ticker reports browser visual `requestAnimationFrame` cadence only. Worker timing, GPU completion observation, and present-scale details are internal diagnostics.


# Performance notes

## Render scale divider

`Render Scale Divider` is the first performance knob.

```text
1 = full resolution
2 = half resolution per axis
4 = quarter resolution per axis
5 = one fifth resolution per axis
```

The playground default is `4`. This computes one quarter resolution per axis and upsamples the current cloud buffer to the full presentation canvas. Coarse rendering does not sample temporal history by default, so it avoids stale coarse-cell reprojection streaks.

## Screen interleave

Screen Interleave is a full-resolution temporal sampling mode. When `Render Scale Divider` is `1`, temporal history can compact-dispatch only the owned 8x8-cell subset for the current phase, so `1 / 4 rays per frame` launches roughly one quarter of the cloud ray work instead of launching all pixels and branching inside the shader.

When `Render Scale Divider` is greater than `1`, the divider already reduces the ray grid. In that mode the renderer bypasses both temporal cell interleave and reprojection history sampling inside the coarse pass. The entire coarse cloud grid is refreshed every frame before upsampling. This avoids stale coarse texels being stretched into vertical, horizontal, or blocky reprojection streaks.

The first full-resolution history-seeding frame always renders all active pixels.

## Tall boxes

This is WIP along with better storm cell formation. Increasing `Box Half Y` is expensive because rays can spend more time inside the vertical cloud slab. The renderer reduces this cost with active-Y ray clipping, a global active-Y early-out, weather-derived column bounds, empty weather skipping, adaptive thick-box stepping, and far-proxy sampling. Still, very tall boxes should use:

- Render Scale Divider `4` or `5`.
- Reprojection enabled while animating.
- Temporal Interleave `1 / 2` or `1 / 4` when animating and history is stable. `1 / 32` and `1 / 64` are included as stress-test modes for evaluating the compact dispatch path.
- Conservative `maxSteps`.
- Protected near detail, but cheaper far interiors.

The default path preserves the original cloud sampling style. `verticalTextureHomogeneity` defaults to `0`, so the extra Y-domain compensation is opt-in.

If you see horizontal layer bands in very tall volumes, keep `verticalTextureHomogeneity` at `0` first to confirm the original look. The slice and Y-decorrelation controls are still available as experimental visual tools, but they are no longer part of the default look.

## Horizon boxes

For clouds stretching to the horizon, prefer larger X/Z cloud boxes plus tiled 4D weather. Do not make the 3D shape/detail textures huge just because the box is huge. The noise transforms and tiling handle the scale and randomness.

## Noise baking

Re-bake only when changing:

- Noise mode.
- Seed.
- Texture size.
- Octave/frequency/warp settings that should be baked into the texture.

Animate with:

- `shapeOffsetWorld`
- `detailOffsetWorld`
- `weatherOffsetWorld`
- `shapeVel`
- `detailVel`
- `weatherVel`
- `time`, when intentionally using 4D noise animation


---
## Coarse rendering and temporal interleave

`Render Scale Divider` controls the internal cloud compute resolution. Values above `1` render to a coarse cloud buffer, then upsample to the full presentation canvas. Temporal interleave is allowed in coarse mode, but coarse updated pixels do not use TAA color blending. This keeps the performance benefit of updating a subset of coarse rays without letting stale color history smear into long vertical or horizontal blocks.

For stable animation, start with Render Scale Divider `4` and Temporal Interleave `1 / 4`. Set Temporal Interleave to `Off / full quality` to test the raw coarse upsample path. If an artifact is unchanged by the interleave selector, it is coming from coarse rendering, upsampling, or the raymarch itself rather than the interleave owner pattern.

## Planet overlay adaptive performance

`planetClouds.js` keeps the presentation canvas at display resolution while adapting the internal spherical raymarch target to projected planet coverage and a pixel budget.

Planet cloud layers start in the regular volumetric `raymarch` mode. Set `cloudRenderMode: 'mc33-shell'` explicitly, or use the render-toggle controller, when the extracted surface renderer is desired.

Both planet renderers use progressive startup by default. The raymarcher returns after a confirmed bootstrap frame built from `128 x 64` weather, `32³` shape, `16³` detail, `64²` blue noise, an internal render divider of `8`, and the small bootstrap cloud pipeline. The expensive full raymarch pipeline compiles concurrently and is awaited only by background refinement. The MC33 renderer starts with `128 x 64` spherical maps and a `28 x 28 x 6` shell field. Full maps, volumes, and geometry buffers refine asynchronously in `layer.refinementPromise`; the confirmed bootstrap image remains visible and animation/extraction dispatch is paused until the swap. Set `progressiveStartup: false` to retain blocking full-quality creation, or await `layer.refinementPromise` when downstream work requires final resources immediately.

`layer.startupTiming` is a live structured report during startup and a completed snapshot afterward. The render-toggle controller forwards both `startupTiming` and `refinementPromise`. Listen for `planet-cloud-startup-timing` or supply `onStartupTiming(report, layer)` for telemetry. Each resource stage includes a separate `gpuWaitMs`, making weather, shape, detail, blue-noise, pipeline, and first-frame stalls directly attributable.

Default controls:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `cloudRenderMode` | `raymarch` | Starts with regular volumetric clouds; `mc33-shell` remains opt-in. |
| `renderScaleDivider` | `1` | Allows full internal resolution when the pixel budget permits it. |
| `maxDpr` | `2` | Caps overlay canvas device-pixel ratio. |
| `maxRaymarchPixels` | `1400000` | Internal raymarch pixel budget when the planet occupies a smaller part of the view. |
| `fullscreenRaymarchPixels` | `1050000` | Internal raymarch pixel budget when the globe fills most of the screen. |
| `adaptiveScreenQuality` | `true` | Raises the effective render divider as projected globe coverage grows. |
| `adaptiveMarchQuality` | `true` | Reduces primary and sun march work under high screen coverage. |
| `animatedTemporalCellRate` | `2` | Updates half of the stationary animated cloud cells per frame. |
| `animatedTemporalBlend` | `0.45` | Keeps half-rate animated sampling while reducing stale lighting and shadow history. |
| `movingFullscreenCoarseFactor` | `1` | Keeps the same coarse factor during and after camera motion. |

The layer creates its default reprojection history explicitly. Initial frames use a lower march budget at the final output resolution, so the atmosphere appears quickly without a low-resolution texture swap. The first stationary frame after camera motion resets history weights in place instead of reallocating history textures.

### Aurora shell motion and palette

The aurora shell uses independent polar spin and side-axis roll. The defaults favor roll over spin:

```js
auroraSpinSpeed: 0.0024,
auroraRollSpeed: 0.0065,
```

The default aurora palette lowers the green channel and gives gold and red bands more range. These colors remain overridable through `params.frontLightColor`, `params.sunColor`, and `params.shadowLightColor`.

Runtime diagnostics are available through `getPlanetCloudPerformanceStats(layer)` or `layer.performanceStats`:

```js
const stats = getPlanetCloudPerformanceStats(planetCloudLayer);
console.table(stats);
```

### Randomized aurora gradients

Aurora gradients use full-spectrum palette families, including green/gold, cyan/blue, violet/magenta, teal/purple, sunset, ruby, rose, and mixed solar palettes.

```js
randomizePlanetAuroraGradient(auroraLayer, {
  auroraGradientRandomAmount: 0.72,
  auroraGreenBoost: 1.0,
});
```

Set `auroraGradientSeed` for a repeatable palette. Set `auroraPaletteFamily` to force a family, or set `auroraRandomizeGradient: false` to use the fixed preset.

## Planet cloud MC33 shell mode

The planet simulation starts in regular raymarch mode. Its bottom-left **Clouds: Raymarch / Clouds: MC33 Shell** button switches renderers and caches the inactive one. Rebaking terrain preserves the selected renderer. Aurora remains raymarched independently.

MC33 now uses the fast `PlanetCloudNoise` setup baker: a periodic 64³ Cartesian shape texture and spherical weather map. Scaling/rotation happen in 3D, not longitude UV, so the field and its detail do not reset at the sphere seam. The signed field follows the regular planet presets, including thin layers, oversized diorama puffs, hemisphere coverage, scattered clouds and gas bands. Changing the style updates both cached renderers.

The thin realistic MC33 mesh additionally hides texture tiling with an oblique Cartesian domain, broad noise warping and a second rotated, offset sample at an incommensurate scale. Contrast compensation retains dense cloud patches. This costs two extra shape reads per field point, not per output vertex; normal projection still uses the cached field. Other mesh styles and the regular raymarcher retain their existing sampling cost. All domains remain continuous across longitude and cube-face boundaries and move with the cloud material, not the camera.

Swirling gas giant uses a separately compiled, cached `gasWeatherNoise` bake. Two smooth-noise gradient octaves drive tangential sphere-curl backtracing, plus seeded vortices and fine filament bands over broad zonal banks. This is the spherical counterpart of the flat curl-FBM technique, not a per-frame fluid simulation or a longitude-space curl warp. The resulting weather texture is shared by raymarch and MC33; the latter also samples its pigment in the fragment shader so fine curls need not become extra triangles. Neighboring latitude bands drift east/west at slightly different speeds, without north/south texture rotation. Differential shear is bounded to 0.12 radians, preserving the baked curls during long animation sessions rather than stretching them into stripes. Aurora and other styles keep their existing motion. Gas curl computation and integration run only during baking; frame work is texture sampling and a small zonal shear calculation.

Default quality remains 96 angular cells per cube face, 11 radial cells, 900,000 vertex capacity and 200,000 active-cell capacity. Field evaluation, compacted MC33 extraction and smooth cached-field normal projection target 60 Hz; the mesh is drawn at the display frame rate. Only one refresh can be in flight, and queue contention lowers the refresh rate to respect a 35% compute budget. A small scheduling tolerance prevents RAF timing jitter from accidentally halving the mesh rate. Camera visibility changes still refresh paused clouds. All stages reuse their GPU buffers. Extraction reserves vertices with one atomic addition per cell instead of a globally contended compare/exchange retry loop; partial overflow reservations emit complete triangles, and draw/dispatch counts are safely clamped.

Styled clouds now use slow common wind (`spinSpeed: 0.00065` turns/second, roughly one revolution per 26 minutes) plus independent Cartesian billow evolution (`evolutionSpeed: 0.03`). Evolution deforms the existing periodic volume without extra texture reads or rebaking. Setting `spinSpeed: 0` leaves evolving clouds stationary; `evolutionSpeed: 0` keeps their shapes fixed. `animate: false` pauses both. Renderer toggles transfer the local animation clock instead of restarting it. Legacy/custom and aurora motion are unchanged. Explicit `surfaceWeatherSpeed` / `surfaceShapeSpeed` overrides retain radians/second units.

```js
updatePlanetCloudLayerOptions(cloudLayer, {
  surfaceAngularCells: 96,
  surfaceRadialCells: 11,
  surfaceFieldUpdateHz: 60,
  surfaceMeshUpdateHz: 60,
  surfaceComputeBudget: 0.35,
  surfaceAnimateTopology: true,
  surfaceMaxVertices: 900000,
  surfaceMaxActiveCells: 200000,
  params: { globalCoverage: 0.82 },
});
await setPlanetCloudStyle(cloudLayer, 'diorama');
```

In the planet simulation's advanced cloud JSON, optional `surface` settings forward these MC33-specific options. Spatial resolution remains fixed as the camera moves. Optional tile culling uses conservative shell bounds rather than a 2D occupancy heuristic that could remove 3D puffs.

`layer.startupTiming` reports setup, async pipeline preparation, noise buffering/dispatch, allocation and first presentation. `layer.performanceStats` includes CPU encoding/submission times, requested and drawn vertex counts, triangle/active-cell counts, overflow flags, requested/effective refresh rates, observed render/field/mesh rates over one-second windows and `computeCompletionMs`. The latter is asynchronous submit-to-completion latency including shared-queue contention, not a hardware GPU timestamp. Counts use a 24-byte asynchronous GPU readback at most once per second; no GPU wait is inserted into the animation loop. Overflow emits a warning rather than silently hiding missing geometry.

Analytic planet occlusion is kept below the cloud base so a tall mountain cannot erase an entire thin layer. This remains a spherical horizon approximation, not per-pixel terrain-depth occlusion. Near-plane triangles use normal GPU clipping when flying through the shell.

The old 2D extrusion controls (`surfaceBulgeStrength`, `surfaceCavityStrength`, `surfaceLowPush`, etc.) no longer define the new 3D morphology; use the shared planet style, shell, coverage and shape scale settings instead.

### Convective shape variation and spherical filtering

Towering Cu and storm cells now vary their base breadth independently of crown
width, including broad lower banks and narrower columns. Material-cell seeds
also vary billow aspect, lean, orientation, canopy thickness and downwind reach.
Those identities move with the wind; they do not get reselected per frame.
Fair cumulus and the original Rain Shelf retain their existing density closure.
The field still uses its 3×3 cell neighborhood and existing shape/detail samples.
A soft footprint bound includes the noisy outer lobes so wide clouds cannot pop
when a cell leaves that neighborhood.

The raymarched planet shell samples shape and detail in continuous, rotated
Cartesian coordinates, rather than fading or resampling them at a longitude
seam. Spherical weather scale blends neighboring integer longitude windings;
fractional scale settings remain seamless. Longitude scales below one retain
one full winding. Aurora ribbon/color frequencies are periodic, and its march
no longer snaps sample radii to discrete shell slices.

`CloudVolumeMips` builds reusable filtered 3D mip chains after planetary noise
bakes, not during camera updates. The shell's visible texture LOD follows actual
texel footprint, retaining close detail and filtering subpixel erosion. This
uses an additional mipmapped copy of each shape/detail volume (roughly 18 MiB
for a 128³ rgba16float volume); obsolete copies are released with their layers.

Validation: `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`, including sphere seam/filtering and
planet surface regressions. Orbit/close captures and GPU timestamp comparisons
from the earlier `/sphere` experiment required diagnostic snapshots that are
not included here; the maintained browser check does not provide that route.
Cloud-pass timings are not full planet-scene FPS or cold startup measurements.

### Cloud variety and regular planet styles

The flat lab adds feather cirrus and a connected, rolling asperitas ceiling.
The automatic weather loop now visits twelve states using the same six cached
weather maps. Kelvin–Helmholtz remains a manual **Experimental** preset; its
curling shapes are still too regular for the automatic cycle. Storm cells vary
their height, width and selection independently and share broken feeder banks.
The original Rain Shelf closure is unchanged.

Regular raymarched planets have a **Planet cloud style** selector:

The shared demo entry now has bottom-right **Flat clouds / Planet clouds** links
(`?demo=flat` or `?demo=planet`). A switch navigates to a fresh document so the
previous GPU scene and worker are released. The planet simulation starts with
the thin realistic raymarch style; choose the other styles at the top of its
Clouds controls. Style switches prepare cloud maps without rebuilding terrain,
update the nested settings editor, and preserve the independent aurora settings.

- Thin realistic layer (`realistic`)
- Big diorama clouds (`diorama`)
- Cloudy hemisphere (`hemisphere`)
- A few puffy clouds (`scattered`)
- Jupiter / curled storms (`gas_giant`): cream/rust banks, an elliptical storm and fine curls
- Neptune / blue storm bands (`neptune`): deep blue, calmer jets, a dark oval and pale ice-cloud streaks
- Hail Mary / green-orange swirls (`hail_mary`): predominantly green with scattered rusty-orange weather regions and fine curling filaments
- Current / custom clouds (`legacy`)

Pass `options.cloudStyle` when creating a layer, or switch an existing layer:

```js
await setPlanetCloudStyle(cloudLayer, 'gas_giant');
```

Use this asynchronous API, not `updatePlanetCloudLayerOptions`, to change a
style: it prepares the new maps, keeps the last completed image visible and
then swaps the bindings. Failed bakes restore the previous style. Camera
movement does not rebake maps. Set `showCloudStyleControl: false` to hide the
selector. Unspecified styles retain the caller's existing/custom settings.
MC33 uses the same presets and baked pigment maps. Aurora remains independent.

In the planet simulation, the Clouds tab starts with live **Lit color** and
**Shadow color** pickers, separate HDR brightness controls, and ray/mesh opacity.
They update existing uniforms without rebaking terrain or cloud textures and
stay synchronized with style changes and the advanced RGB controls. Gas presets
retain their pigment palettes; these colors tint their lighting. The renderer
switch sits at the bottom right, above demo navigation and clear of the sidebar.
Hail Mary's default opacity is 0.78 for raymarch and 0.72 for MC33, giving its
green/orange atmosphere more presence while retaining some terrain visibility.

All seven non-legacy styles share the compact `computeCloudPlanet` entrypoint. Their
small setup-only shape and weather shaders produce smooth, periodic noise;
gas bands include localized spherical vortices. Shape/detail use filtered 3D
mips and continuous Cartesian coordinates. Coverage and gas bands rotate in
a continuous spherical domain. Rounded radial profiles keep the large puffs
from reading as straight-sided slabs. Lighting normals use the unsaturated
shape field, preserving relief inside opaque clouds with the same three shape
reads. Close views refresh those normals more often while sun probes remain
capped at three. The new presets
disable the visibly different bootstrap image and unused legacy noise warmups.

The gas variants share one lazy setup pipeline, selected by a bake uniform.
Jupiter has unequal, locally disturbed belts, pale equatorial zones, ochre
poles and a distinctly red storm core. Neptune takes a shorter bake path:
gentle blue variation, a few thin broken ice-cloud lanes and a small dark spot,
without the giant-eddy integration. Its lighting is predominantly radial so
the quiet atmosphere does not look like lumpy blue terrain; the raymarcher also
skips the unnecessary three shape-normal probes. Hail Mary adds a small-scale
curl octave and eighteen uneven local vortices to the broad flow. A separate
low-frequency noise field selects scattered rusty-orange regions, replacing
the previous half-planet red/green split. Long oblique threads follow the
backtraced flow at two scales; gentler integration keeps them resolved instead
of folding into sub-texel speckles. Its moss/emerald palette has warm orange-red
patches and restrained yellow-green highlights, without latitude stripes.
Lower extinction and translucent raymarch
and mesh presets let the mountain surface show through instead of replacing it
with an opaque neon shell. These extra curl calculations are still setup-only.
Their palette is shared between raymarch and MC33 in `shaders/planetGasAppearance.wgsl`;
switching variants adds no frame-time texture reads or render pipelines. Oval
storms are warped in a continuous Cartesian tangent frame. The expensive curl
integration remains setup-only, and the motion preserves each band's latitude.

Planet temporal history is allocated at the actual coarse raymarch dimensions,
not the reconstructed overlay size. Changing that size seeds one full fresh
frame before interleaving resumes; this avoids a smaller corner-copy ghost when
the camera stops. `performanceStats.historyWidth`, `historyHeight` and
`historyWarmupActive` expose those decisions without GPU readback.
An absent motion-vector input is zero; the old half-UNORM fallback shifted
stationary history horizontally by half a pixel every frame.

The earlier `/planet-styles` experiment used a simple diagnostic globe for
orbit/inside captures, GPU timestamps and seam probes; its server/snapshots are
not included here. Use **Planet clouds** in the shared demo to review the actual
planet simulation. The layer's startup timing object and performance stats
remain available for measuring setup and cloud-pass work separately from
whole-scene FPS.
